## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Malagasy child aged 8 years old is learning about geography but doesn't understand what a "continent" means. They want to ask for help in a friendly way and receive simple explanations that help them continue learning without feeling discouraged.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a child is stuck on a mathematics problem, **When** they ask "Can you help me with this?", **Then** the chatbot provides step-by-step guidance appropriate for their age
2. **Given** a child wants to know more about a topic, **When** they ask "Tell me about Madagascar", **Then** they receive culturally relevant information in simple French
3. **Given** a child makes an error, **When** they ask why their answer was wrong, **Then** the chatbot explains the concept clearly with encouragement
4. **Given** a child needs motivation, **When** they express frustration, **Then** the chatbot provides positive reinforcement and suggests next steps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a child asks inappropriate questions?
