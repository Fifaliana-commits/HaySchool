**Feature Branch**: `002-interactive-learning-system`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "interactive-learning-system"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT children need for engaging learning experiences
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, animations, game mechanics)
- üë• Written for educators and child psychologists, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Malagasy child aged 7-10 years old wants to learn mathematics through interactive activities that feel like games, with immediate feedback that helps them understand concepts better and motivates them to continue learning.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a child is learning about addition, **When** they drag numbers to combine them, **Then** they see visual representations that help them understand the concept
2. **Given** a child answers a question incorrectly, **When** the system provides feedback, **Then** it explains the correct answer in simple terms with encouragement
3. **Given** a child completes a learning activity, **When** they finish successfully, **Then** they receive a celebration with progress tracking
4. **Given** a child struggles with a concept, **When** they request additional help, **Then** the system provides simpler examples and step-by-step guidance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a child gets frustrated and wants to quit?
- How does the system handle children with different attention spans?
- What happens if a child repeatedly answers incorrectly?
- How does the system adapt to children who learn at different paces?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
