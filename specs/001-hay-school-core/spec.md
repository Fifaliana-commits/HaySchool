## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Malagasy child aged 6-12 years old wants to learn through an engaging, interactive platform that teaches core subjects (Math, French, Sciences, History, Geography, English) while maintaining cultural relevance and providing immediate feedback on their progress.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a child first visits the platform, **When** they complete the profile creation, **Then** they see personalized learning recommendations based on their age and interests
2. **Given** a child is learning mathematics, **When** they answer a question correctly, **Then** they receive immediate positive feedback and progress tracking
3. **Given** a child encounters difficulty with a concept, **When** they request help, **Then** the chatbot provides contextual, age-appropriate assistance
4. **Given** a child completes a subject module, **When** they finish all lessons, **Then** they unlock achievements and see their overall progress

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a child has no internet connection?
- How does the system handle children with different learning paces?
- What happens if a child accidentally navigates away during a quiz?
- How does the system ensure content is appropriate for different age groups?
